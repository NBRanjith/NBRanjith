# Hi there, I'm Ranjith ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I'm a Data analyst with a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science from Western University, Ontario, Canada. Iâ€™m currently learning data analysis and am passionate about it. Iâ€™m also enthusiastic about data-driven decision-making and machine learning. Iâ€™m actively looking for full-time opportunities where I can apply my skills and continue to grow.

## Projects
